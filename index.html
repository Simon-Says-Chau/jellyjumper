						<h2 class="title">Jelly Jumper</h2>
							<p> In this Unity made game, my friends/colleagues and myself attempt to create a game.  The game was made for a Hack-A-Thon at UCR.  During the process of making the game
								my part was to ensure that platforms were either fake or real.  The game was created from a skeleton code that we were allowed to use.  From that skeleton code
								we were able to adjust and change what we needed to make the game work as intended.  We competed for the category of "Memory" and won first place.  Since this was our
								first time competing/creating, we did not have much knowledge to create a fully developed game; however it was a fun experience.  
								Although a very simplistic game, there was a bit of a learning curve to understand Unity and how to program within it.</p>
